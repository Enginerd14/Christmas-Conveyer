I decided on making a christmas conveyer belt to help Santa sort his Naughty and Nice presents ;) 

I wanted to make as much of the parts using a 3D printer as possible so I decided on making everything except the bearings using a printer. 

My plan is to use rollers with gears at either side I can use timing belts between rollers and only require one motor. Then I will use a TCRT5000 IR sensor that will detect how much of the IR light is reflected back. Coal will relfect very little back causing the rollers to spin clockwise. A gift wrapped present will reflect most of the light so rollers will spin anticlockwise. 

I began designing my own PCB using the ATMega328p
